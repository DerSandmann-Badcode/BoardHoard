# What is BoardHoard?

BoardHoard is intended as a replacement to the great Chan Thread Watch, which was a thread watcher for *chan-style imageboards.
Imageboard software is similar in conception to bulletin-board forum software, although cosmetically they differ drastically. The basic idea is that users can post to share images and comments. The most commonly-cited English-language example of a bulletin board is 4chan (www.4chan.org), which I would suggest you visit if the concept is new to you.

BoardHoard attempts to fill the gap left by the obsolescence of Chan Thread Watch, a program that would download all the images and HTML posted to any thread on any board the software was compatible with on a regular basis. The creator worked hard to ensure compatibility with as many different board types as possible, and as a result the program was reliable and adaptable to many different situations.

The following features are intended for BoardHoard:

- Compatibility with different bulletin board software releases (Yotsuba, Kusaba (Kusaba X), etc.)
- Saving of thread images, thumbnails and HTML as instructed by the user
- Ability to regularly check threads for updates (30 seconds - 24 hours)
- Downloading of WebM videos for 4chan
- Image hash verification on supported boards

# What platforms is it intended to be run on?

Currently, plans only exist for BoardHoard to run on Windows, as it has by far the largest market share of any operating system; however, concrete details remain to be seen. Plans for official releases for other operating systems may be introduced if Board Hoard is accepted well by the community.

# What stage of development is it at?

Currently Board Hoard exists purely theoretically. A few minds are currently looking over the project to see if it would benefit from their involvement; updates will be posted here.
